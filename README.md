I think the loaction is a big factor at play. As long as people feel safe staying in that neighbourhood 
and depending on what they want to do while they stay there, they won't care so much if the price is slightly higher than they planned. Reviews are another big factor. Many people do their research before staying anywhere, hotels, AirBnB, rentals. 
If reviews are bad, people staying at that particular place is low.
